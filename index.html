    <p>LB: "So I've had undiagnosed chronic pain for the last 12 years. Mixture of lower back, should, neck, head pain. Tension headaches, migraines, I've tried lots for it, still trying. But one symptom in particular is worst pain on my period, when I have my period. Sometimes my migraines and tension headaches are so bad I'm fainting. I'd be vomiting, I'd be stuck in a dark room lying down. So I decided, because I don't want biological children, I'd like to foster, that aout 5 years ago, when I was 25, to go to a doctor and ask for a hysterectomy. And rather than explaining how invasive that is and how it would mean taking a pill for a long time to avoid early menopause and lots of other things that I found out from, you know, other women, the doctor just said 'Oh you might change your mind. What if you decide you want children and then it's too late?'. A female doctor as well. And I've known I haven't wanted children since I was 12. And rather than acknowledging the phycail pain I was in, they instead just said 'Why don't you stick this hook up you? This is more effective.' And yet I've heard from a lot of women that it's quite painful and it doesn't always work and it can even get stuck inside you. Yeah, so not ideal."</p>
